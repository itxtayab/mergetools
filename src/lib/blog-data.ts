                body: `Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It uses a set of 64 characters — uppercase letters (A–Z), lowercase letters (a–z), digits (0–9), plus (+), and forward slash (/) — to encode data.\n\nThe name "Base64" comes from this 64-character alphabet. Every three bytes of binary data are converted into four Base64 characters, making the encoded output roughly 33% larger than the original data.\n\nBase64 encoding is essential in modern web development because many protocols and systems — such as email (MIME), URLs, and JSON — are designed to handle text, not raw binary. By converting binary into text, Base64 ensures that data remains intact during transport.`,

                body: `The Base64 encoding process follows these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Convert to Binary**\nTake the input data and convert each byte into its 8-bit binary representation.\n\n**Step 2: Group into 6-bit Chunks**\nCombine all the bits and split them into groups of 6 bits each. If the last group has fewer than 6 bits, pad it with zeros.\n\n**Step 3: Map to Base64 Characters**\nEach 6-bit group maps to one of the 64 characters in the Base64 alphabet. For example, the binary value 000000 maps to 'A', 000001 maps to 'B', and so on.\n\n**Step 4: Add Padding**\nIf the original data isn't evenly divisible by 3 bytes, the output is padded with one or two '=' characters to make it a multiple of 4 characters.\n\nFor example, encoding the text "Hi" produces "SGk=" — the '=' sign indicates padding was needed.`,

This eliminates extra HTTP requests and can improve page load performance for small icons and logos.\n\n**Email Attachments (MIME)**\nEmail systems use Base64 to encode binary attachments like images, PDFs, and documents so they can be transmitted safely through text-based email protocols.\n\n**API Authentication**\nHTTP Basic Authentication encodes the username:password combination in Base64 before sending it in the Authorization header. While this isn't encryption, it ensures special characters don't break the HTTP protocol.\n\n**Storing Binary Data in JSON**\nJSON doesn't natively support binary data. Base64 encoding lets you include images, files, or encrypted data within JSON payloads.\n\n**JWT Tokens**\nJSON Web Tokens use Base64url encoding (a URL-safe variant) for the header and payload segments, making them safe to include in URLs and HTTP headers.`,

AES, RSA, and ChaCha20 are examples of encryption algorithms.\n\nIf you need to protect sensitive data, always use proper encryption. Base64 should only be used to ensure binary data can be safely transmitted through text-based channels.`,

Supported Data Types**\nJSON supports: strings, numbers, booleans (true/false), null, objects, and arrays. It does not support undefined, functions, dates, or comments.\n\n**4. Strings Must Use Double Quotes**\nAll string values must use double quotes. Single quotes will cause a parsing error.\n\n**5. No Comments**\nStandard JSON does not support comments.

Unescaped characters cause parse failures.\n\n**Incorrect Nesting**\nMismatched curly braces {} or square brackets [] create invalid JSON. A formatter with bracket matching helps identify nesting issues.\n\n**Using Single Quotes**\nSingle quotes are valid in JavaScript but not in JSON. Replace all single quotes with double quotes.\n\n**Numbers with Leading Zeros**\nJSON numbers cannot have leading zeros (e.g., 007 is invalid). Use 7 instead, or encode it as a string "007" if the leading zeros matter.`,

Invalid JSON causes silent failures that are difficult to debug.\n\n**Keep Structures Flat When Possible**\nDeeply nested JSON is hard to read and work with. Flatten structures when the nesting doesn't add meaningful value.\n\n**Use Descriptive Key Names**\nChoose clear, descriptive key names over abbreviations. "firstName" is better than "fn" for long-term maintainability.\n\n**Minify for Production**\nWhile formatted JSON is great for development, always minify JSON in production to reduce payload size and improve performance.`,

Whether you're crafting a blog post, submitting an essay, or writing a product description, the number of words directly impacts how your content performs.\n\n**For SEO:** Search engines consider content depth as a ranking factor. Longer, comprehensive articles tend to rank higher because they provide more value and cover topics thoroughly. Studies consistently show that top-ranking pages typically contain 1,500–2,500 words.\n\n**For Readers:** Content length affects reading time and engagement. Too short, and readers feel the topic wasn't covered adequately. Too long, and readers lose interest and bounce.\n\n**For Academics:** Essays, dissertations, and research papers have strict word count requirements. Going over or under can result in grade penalties.\n\n**For Social Media:** Each platform has character or word limits. Twitter/X has 280 characters, LinkedIn posts perform best at 1,300 characters, and Instagram captions cap at 2,200 characters.`,

Everything runs client-side in your browser, which keeps performance high and respects your privacy.\n\n**Formatting, Validation, and Minification**\n\nYou paste JSON, hit format, and immediately see pretty printed output with consistent indentation. Under the hood, the DevPik tool validates at the same time, surfacing an error message and line or column location when the structure breaks.\n\nWhen you need the smallest payload, you can flip the behavior and minify instead, stripping extra whitespace for compact transport.

Other times you just want to click into nested objects without counting brackets. DevPik supports both styles.\n\nIn code view you get formatted JSON in an editor with indentation and highlighting, perfect for quick fixes. Switch to tree view and each JSON object or JSON array becomes expandable nodes, so you can collapse sections and focus on the fields that matter.\n\n**Productivity Shortcuts and Clipboard Integration**\n\nWhen you are formatting JSON dozens of times a day, small time savers add up.

                heading: "What Is Agentic AI?",
                body: `Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously — planning, reasoning, making decisions, and executing multi-step tasks with minimal or no human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to a single prompt and returns a single output, **agentic AI** can break down complex goals into sub-tasks, use external tools, and iterate on its own results until the objective is achieved.\n\nThe term "agentic" comes from the concept of an **AI agent** — a software entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. While chatbots like early versions of ChatGPT were reactive (you ask, they answer), agentic AI systems are proactive. They can identify what needs to be done next, call APIs, search the web, write and execute code, and even collaborate with other AI agents.\n\nIn 2026, agentic AI has emerged as one of the most transformative trends in technology, with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft all racing to build increasingly capable AI agent frameworks.`,

                heading: "How Do AI Agents Work?",
                body: `AI agents operate through a loop of perception, reasoning, and action — often called the **agent loop**. Here's how it works:\n\n**1. Goal Setting**\nThe user provides a high-level objective, such as "research competitors and create a market analysis report." The agent decomposes this into smaller, actionable steps.\n\n**2. Planning and Reasoning**\nUsing large language models (LLMs) as their reasoning engine, agents create a plan of action. They decide which tools to use, what data to gather, and in what order to execute tasks.\n\n**3. Tool Use**\nModern AI agents can interact with external tools — web browsers, code interpreters, databases, APIs, file systems, and more. This is what sets them apart from simple chatbots.\n\n**4. Execution and Iteration**\nThe agent executes each step, evaluates the results, and adjusts its plan if something fails or if new information emerges. This self-correcting behavior is the hallmark of agentic AI.\n\n**5. Memory and Context**\nAdvanced agents maintain short-term and long-term memory, allowing them to reference earlier steps, learn from mistakes, and maintain context across complex workflows.\n\nThis architecture enables agents to handle tasks that would require dozens of manual steps — from debugging codebases to orchestrating business workflows.`,

                body: `Several converging factors have made 2026 the breakout year for agentic AI:\n\n**Massive Investment**\nOpenAI raised $110 billion (backed by SoftBank, Amazon, and NVIDIA) specifically to build AI agent infrastructure. Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic have all launched dedicated agent platforms.\n\n**Better Foundation Models**\nModels like GPT-5, Claude 4, and Gemini Ultra have dramatically improved reasoning, reducing hallucinations and enabling reliable multi-step task execution.\n\n**Enterprise Adoption**\nBusinesses are moving beyond chatbots. Companies now deploy AI agents for customer support escalation, automated code review, financial analysis, supply chain optimization, and HR onboarding.\n\n**Open-Source Momentum**\nFrameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Semantic Kernel have made it accessible for developers to build custom AI agents without starting from scratch.\n\n**Tool Ecosystems**\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar standards have created interoperable tool ecosystems, allowing agents to seamlessly plug into databases, APIs, browsers, and development environments.\n\nAccording to Gartner, by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI capabilities — up from less than 1% in 2024.`,

                body: `Agentic AI is already being deployed across industries. Here are the most impactful use cases:\n\n**Software Development**\nAI coding agents (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, and Cline) can read entire codebases, plan refactors, write implementations across multiple files, run tests, and iterate on failures — all from a single high-level instruction.\n\n**Customer Support**\nAI agents handle complex customer queries by accessing order databases, processing refunds, scheduling callbacks, and escalating edge cases to human agents — resolving up to 60% of tickets autonomously.\n\n**Data Analysis and Reporting**\nBusiness intelligence agents connect to data warehouses, write SQL queries, generate visualizations, and produce formatted reports — turning hours of analyst work into minutes.\n\n**DevOps and Infrastructure**\nAgents monitor system health, diagnose incidents, apply patches, scale infrastructure, and even write post-mortem reports from log analysis.\n\n**Content and Marketing**\nMarketing agents research trending topics, perform keyword analysis, draft SEO-optimized content, schedule social posts, and adapt strategies based on performance metrics.\n\n**Personal Productivity**\nAgents manage calendars, draft emails, research topics, book travel, organize files, and coordinate across tools like Slack, Notion, and Google Workspace.`,

You provide the input, and it returns the output.\n\n**Agentic AI** excels at complex, multi-step workflows where the path to the solution isn't fully known in advance. It can explore, experiment, backtrack, and adapt — much like a human knowledge worker.\n\nThe key insight is that agentic AI doesn't replace traditional AI — it builds on top of it. The foundation models are the same, but the agent architecture adds planning, tool use, and iterative execution layers.`,

Understand the Frameworks**\nStart with established frameworks: LangGraph (by LangChain) for Python-based agents, Microsoft's AutoGen for multi-agent collaboration, or CrewAI for role-based agent teams. Each has different strengths.\n\n**2. Master Prompt Engineering for Agents**\nAgent prompts differ from chat prompts. You need to define the agent's role, available tools, constraints, output format, and decision-making criteria. System prompts for agents are typically much more detailed.\n\n**3. Build Tool Integrations**\nAgents are only as powerful as the tools they can use. Start by connecting simple tools (web search, file read/write, code execution) and gradually add domain-specific capabilities.\n\n**4. Implement Guard Rails**\nAutonomous AI needs boundaries. Implement approval workflows for destructive actions, rate limits for API calls, cost controls for LLM usage, and logging for auditability.\n\n**5. Start Small, Then Scale**\nBegin with a single-purpose agent (e.g., an automated code reviewer or a log analysis agent) before building multi-agent systems. Validate reliability before adding complexity.\n\nThe developer tools ecosystem at DevPik is expanding to include AI tool integrations — stay tuned for interactive tools that help you build, test, and debug AI agent workflows directly in your browser.`,

                body: `Here's a practical decision guide based on common use cases:\n\n**For coding and development:**\nClaude > ChatGPT > Perplexity. Claude's reasoning and large context window make it the best coding assistant. ChatGPT's code interpreter is useful for data analysis. Perplexity is not designed for coding.\n\n**For research and fact-checking:**\nPerplexity > ChatGPT > Claude. Perplexity's real-time sourced search is unmatched. ChatGPT can browse the web but doesn't consistently cite sources. Claude has limited web access.\n\n**For creative writing:**\nChatGPT ≈ Claude > Perplexity. Both produce excellent creative content, with ChatGPT being more versatile and Claude being more nuanced. Perplexity is too search-focused for creative work.\n\n**For image generation:**\nChatGPT > Others. Only ChatGPT has built-in image generation via DALL-E 3.\n\n**For enterprise use:**\nClaude > ChatGPT > Perplexity. Claude's safety focus, long context, and API reliability make it the enterprise favorite. ChatGPT Team/Enterprise plans are also strong.\n\n**For students:**\nPerplexity > Claude > ChatGPT. Perplexity's cited sources help with academic integrity. Claude's careful reasoning helps with understanding complex topics. ChatGPT's free tier is the most accessible.\n\n**The power move:** Use all three. Many professionals combine Perplexity for research, Claude for deep analysis and coding, and ChatGPT for multimedia tasks. At $60/month total (or free with limited tiers), the combination covers virtually every AI use case.`,
